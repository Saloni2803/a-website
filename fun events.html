<h1>Alumni Event That Make Reconnecting Fun</h1><br>
23 Oct 2015 in Special Events	by	Paul McKeon 0 Comments Share
If you were in a sorority, fraternity, a graduate, or were a workshop attendee, chances are you’ve been invited to an alumni event. Perhaps you’ve been asked to plan an alumni event of your own. Maybe it’s a struggle finding original and different alumni event ideas. If you’re looking for some ideas on where to start, you’ve come to the right place.

<h2>Why Plan Alumni Events?</h2><br>
Alumni Event Ideas That Make Reconnecting Fun - Team Building With TasteAlumni events are a great way to reconnect with staff, teachers, as well as maintain your connections with old friends.

In some cases, you can help give back to your school or organization by providing students with the opportunity to meet  and learn from people in the industry. Giving back to the community also helps promote your school or organization.

In other cases, alumni form clubs which regularly participate in activities throughout the year. Group events are great for social gatherings, learning from each other, or exploring new activities together.

Either way, alumni take an active role in their community and have fun while doing so!

<h3>Alumni Event Ideas</h3><br>
The possibilities for alumni events are almost endless. You can do anything with your alumni group that you can do with your friends. Here are some ideas to get you started.
<ul>
<li>>Kickball</li>
<li>Bowling</li>

<li>Other Team Sports</li>

<li>Hiking</li>

<li>Bicycling</li>

<li>Formal or Semi-Formal Dinners</li>

<li>Restaurant Get-Together</li>

<li>Volunteer/Community Service</li>

<li>Picnics</li>

<li>Plan a Professional Development Seminar</li>

<li>Book Clubs</li>

<li>Take Art Classes</li>

<li>Attend Concerts or Theatre Events</li>

<li>Museum Visits</li>
</ul>
<br>

The purpose of alumni events is to get people together, communicate, forge new relationships, and maintain existing connections. As a result, less interactive events such as movies may not be as effective or fulfilling.

Cooking Competition for Different Alumni Event Ideas
Cooking Competition for Your Alumni EventWhether you’re part of a club which participates in regular events throughout the year, or you’re starting a new tradition, Team Building With Taste is a unique setting for alumni gatherings.

Our setup is much like the cooking competition challenges you see on TV. Participants are divided into groups, and each group is tasked with cooking a multi-course meal within a set time limit. There is plenty of room for teams to be as innovative as desired.

To spice things up, our curve ball challenges will test everyone’s creativity and problem solving skills, and encourage participants to work together to win.

Once the last meal is plated and the burners turned off, each team’s dishes are judged according to timeliness, presentation, and taste. Winning teams can be awarded prizes, and everyone gets to enjoy the meals they’ve prepared.

Food engages people in distinct way since everyone can relate. Our kitchen’s safe and fun environment encourages people who have never cooked before to try their hand, while experienced home chefs can experiment with new techniques or ingredients.

<h4>Team Building With Taste</h4><br>
